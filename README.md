**Gaming Social Network**

Game Social Network is an innovative application designed to organize and manage users' game collections and enable active interaction in the gamer community. It offers a wide range of functionality, including user registration with email verification, easy game management (including creation, editing, sharing and archiving), the ability to rent games based on their availability, and a process for returning and confirming the return of games.

The application is based on security best practices, using JWT tokens for authentication and authorization, and following REST API design best practices to ensure reliable performance and protection of user data. Thanks to the use of Spring Boot 3 and Spring Security 6 technologies in the backend, as well as Angular with Bootstrap for front-end development
